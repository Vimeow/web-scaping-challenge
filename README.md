#The Mars News website is operated by edX Boot Camps LLC for educational purposes only. The news article titles, summaries, dates, and images were scraped from NASA's Mars News website in November 2022. Images are used according to the JPL Image Use Policy, courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.

#The data had been used for completing web-scraping-challenge assignment from the Data Analytics boot camp course (The University of Adelaide).

#Incuded in this repository are also codes written by Vy Nguyen, owner of this repository. The idea for formulating the code came mainly from the Data Analytics boot camp course and the internet community.
